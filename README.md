This is a music app written in flutter.
As someone who really wants to like the open source space, I find really few apps that match the quality of design that I am looking for.
So I took it upon myself to create a series of apps that match all my expectations. This also gives me the opportunity to work on my skills and learn 
about the world of open source development. 
If you have any suggestions/bugs that you notice, feel free to let me know.
